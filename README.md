# Introduction

Cross-site scripting (also known as XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with a vulnerable application

Cross-site scripting works by manipulating a vulnerable web site so that it returns malicious JavaScript to users  \


There are three main types of XSS attacks. These are:

* Reflected XSS, where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
* Stored XSS, where the malicious script comes from the website's database.
* DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.
